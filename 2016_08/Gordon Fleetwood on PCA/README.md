## An Introduction To Principal Component Analysis

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org:/repo/gfleetwood/pca_presentation)

This was a presentation given at the New York Data Science Study Group's [meeting for August](http://www.meetup.com/NYC-Data-Science-Study-Group/events/227860773/). I used the Jupyter plugin [nbpresent](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/jupyter-notebook-extensions#notebook-present) to convert cells to slides within the notebook itself.

The ['launch|binder'](http://mybinder.org/) button allows for exploration of the notebook on a temporary Jupyter server. I made changes after the talk to accomodate this addition. The major change involved accessing the KDD data directly from the url.
